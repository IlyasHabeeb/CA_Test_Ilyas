# CAtest
test for candidate CAs for CUSP ADS and PUI classes.


Instructions: each piece of instruction is contained in a cell in the notebook PUI ADS CA test.ipynb. 

*This is not a close-book test: feel free to use any resources (google, stackoverflow, books) that you want! *

**PREFERRED DELIVERY METHOD**
Fork this github repository on your own github, make that repository private and make fedhere a collaborator. Upload your solution to this repository. 

**OTHERWISE**
If you are not familiar with github and you cannot figure out how to follow the instructions above you can email the solution.

There are 4 sections: 
  - data actuisition and cleaning, 
  - data display, 
  - modeling, and 
  - assessing the model. 


If you cannot complete a task or a section feel free to ask for the solution for that portion of the exercise. There are multiple aspects we will evaluate you on and it is expected that you will be  stronger on some tasks than on others. We will use this information to best fit you in our CA assignments. For example, if you cannot read in the data as we are asking, you can as for a clean dataset so that you can show you can do the modeling part. If you are in this situation send us an email. 

Try to write clean, readable code. This will also be a parameter of evaluation.
